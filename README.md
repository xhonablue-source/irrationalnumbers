## 📘 Overview

This MathCraft module introduces students to **irrational numbers** through storytelling, physical analogy, and interactive graphs. It features `log₁₀(3)` — an irrational number that’s 47.7% of the way between 1 and 10 on a log scale.

> 💡 “Trying to slice a cake at log₁₀(3) is like cutting it at a moving target — it never divides evenly!”
